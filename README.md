# Visp

### Introduction
Visp, an app to convert Lisp-code into a visual tree structure.

### Installation
Currently it is only some HTML+CSS+Javascript+JQuery, so downloading and opening in a browser is sufficient. Only tested in Chrome though.

### Backstory
As my partner needed to learn some Lisp for a thing at work, I tried to learn some myself so I could then teach it. As I tried to explain the concept of the language, I tended to draw the code as a tree diagram to better be able to explain. This is therefore a tool to explain the concept of Lisp to beginner programmers, particular to those without a background in functional programming.

### Potential
If I continue on this project it could turn out to be a intuitive tool for visual programming, with animations showing how the calculations is done.
Best case scenario: Kids use this instead of tools like Scratch when learning programming and the functional programming revolution is soon upon us.
